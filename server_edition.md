## Server Edition

This edition is for researchers looking to implement a customized version of the Web Historian extension. The interface is a step-by-step informed consent process, rather than the more exploratory approach in the Education Edition. This version requires the researchers to set up a server to receive the data donation. If you need help setting this up for your project, please contact EMT LLC. 

Not all research requires the server edition. If you do not need to collect data from participants' browsers, just their reactions in an interview for example, you can use the Education Edition. If you are doing a small project with tech-savvy participants that trust you, you could ask them to review their data in the Educational Edition and send you the json file they download after they have redacted what they do not want to share.

Here is [an example](./consent_example.html) of a consent form for a Web Historian project where the browsing data and survey data were collected.
