## Server Edition

[Code on Github](https://github.com/WebHistorian/community)

This edition is for researchers looking to implement a customized version of the 
Web Historian extension for their project. The interface is a step-by-step informed 
consent process, rather than the more exploratory approach in the Education 
Edition. This version requires the researchers to set up a server to receive 
the data donation to make it as easy as possible for participants to contribute. 
If you need help setting this up for your project, please 
contact [EMT LLC](https://erickaakcire.github.io/emtllc.html). 

Not all research requires the server edition. If you do not need to collect data 
from participants' browsers, just their responses to their visualizations in an interview for example, 
you can use the Education Edition. If you are doing a project that does require the browsing data
with relatively tech-savvy participants that trust you, you could ask them to review their 
data in the Educational Edition and send you the json file they download after they have 
redacted what they do not want to share.

Here is [an example](./consent_example.html) of a consent form for a Web Historian 
project for a US based institution where browsing data and survey data were collected. 

Please cite the Web Historian paper if you use any edition the tool in your work.
