## About Us
Web Historian is a browser extension that helps you visualize the web browsing history that is 
already on your computer in a way you’ve never seen before. You can see what you’ve been looking 
for online and how you navigate through the web using interactive visuals.

Many companies collect and analyze web browsing history for marketing and advertising purposes, but 
browsing history data has been less accessible to those who want to analyze their own web browsing 
behavior. Similarly, many academic researchers have not had to rely on surveys or interviews alone to answer questions 
about our increasingly digital society. That is why Web Historian was created. There are two separate
version of the extension, the Educational Edition for individuals (no data is collected) and the
server edition for researchers to use the interactive visualizations as part of a step-by-step informed consent 
process for including web browsing data into a research project.

Web Historian was created by [Ericka Menchen-Trevino](http://www.ericka.cc/), Assistant Professor at American University in Washtington D.C.
