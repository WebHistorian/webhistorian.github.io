## About Us
Web Historian is a tool that lets you see your web browsing history in a new and exciting way. It's an add-on for your browser that shows your online activities through visualizations.

Companies often study people's web browsing history to advertise to them, but it's been hard for regular people or researchers to do the same. That's why Web Historian was made. It has two versions: one for everyday users that keeps your data private, and another for researchers to use in their projects with permission.

Web Historian was created by [Ericka Menchen-Trevino](http://www.ericka.cc/), Assistant Professor at American University in Washtington D.C.
