Web Historian is a browser extension that helps you visualize the web browsing history that is already on your computer in a way you’ve never seen before. You can see what you’ve been looking for online and how you navigate through the web using interactive visuals.

Web Historian is an open source project developed specifically to provide users with as much transparency and control over their own information as possible. When users install Web Historian they download a program that runs only on their computer using clientside JavaScript. Users can remove anything they want from their browsing history with a simple right-click.
