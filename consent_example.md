### Identification of Investigators & Purpose of Study
You are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Ericka Menchen-Trevino from American University. The purpose of this study is to better understand how digital media consumption relates to the way that people understand the world.

### Research Procedures
This study consists of web browsing history data collection, this survey, and a very brief survey immediately following this survey. In order to reach this survey, you have already begun uploading your web browsing history data. If you do not consent to participate in the research your web browsing history data will not be used for research purposes.

In this survey you will be asked to provide answers to a series of questions related to web use, media and communication, political attitudes, and your individual characteristics. This survey does link your responses to the browsing data you contributed but it does not request personally identifying information.

The brief survey that appears after this one has been completed cannot be linked to this survey or to your browsing history data.

Eligible participants who complete this study will be compensated (amount).
